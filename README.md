## Notes & Skills Learned
As my first decently sized project, this was very fun to make and also really eye opening when it comes to being a developer. One of the major issues I kept running into
was organization of my classes and files. Even though commenting is good, being able to have a clean structure makes or breaks a program and I'd say my lack of planning
undermined my progress and the games performance. Having over 10+ classes with messy imports and includes really taught me that knowing how to solve problems isn't everything. 
Its the structural planning, ability to expand, and organization of my program in the big picture that matters the most.

### Things I've Learned
1. Clearly seperate logic/backend from ui/front end elements (add folders)
2. Have a structure and hierachy of classes so you don't run into include loops and import messes
3. Minimize global variables and avoid importing unused libraries
